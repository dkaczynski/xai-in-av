\section{Challenges in XAI} \label{sec:Challenges}

These challenges are important, but make sure to relate them back to the existing and proposed research in XAI/AV.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature relevancy can be compromised by using a mask on the input that is virtually undetectable to the human eye \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1812-00891}.

    \item The concept of an explanation is subjective; there is no quantitative way of saying "yes, this decision is explained" or "no, this decision is not explained." \cite{Bibal2016}

    \item Due to the diverse audience of XAI, an explanation may be too technical or not technical enough to people of different backgrounds.
    
    \item Private industry is rarely incentivized to expose algorithms and ML models to researchers \cite{Veale:2018:FAD:3173574.3174014}.
\end{itemize}
